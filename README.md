Model of taxon presence as a function individual ecology and both regional and global climate

- just model of presence, i'm not comparing origination vs extinction
- observation probability modeled with latent variable approach
- allowing temporal effect as draws from shared distribution with constant mean
- individual-level covariates include mass, dietary category, locomotor category (and phylogenetic effect).
- group-level covariates include isotope mean, range (and temperature estimate) as well as the environmental/floristic phase according to Graham.
