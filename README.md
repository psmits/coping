Model of taxon presence as a function individual ecology and both regional and global climate

- just model of presence, i'm not comparing origination vs extinction
  - scratch that, now both pure-presence and a birth-death
- observation probability modeled with latent variable approach
- allowing temporal effect as draws from shared distribution with constant mean
- individual-level covariates include mass, ecotype -- interaction between locomotor and dietary category
- group-level covariates include temperature mean, range as well as the environmental/floristic phase according to Graham.
- can then back estimate diversity through time
  - birth rate, death rate
  - ecotype specific number of originations and extinctions
