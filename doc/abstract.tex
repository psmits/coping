  % the set of species in a region changes over time
  % species turnover
  % is there any structure to how a species pool changes over time?
  %   what would this structure mean?
  %   let's think about this through the lens of species interactions
  %     both biotic-biotic and biotic-abiotic
  % operationalize this all as a multi-level Bayesian hidden Markov model
  %   takes into account incomplete-ness information
  %     along with body size effect on sampling
  %   pure-presence and birth-death
  %   ecotype variation, individual level
  %     oh and body size
  %   group-level 
  %     plant phase
  %     global temperature
  % results are expansive
  %   environmental context affects origination probability 
  %   environmental context does not affect survival probability
  %   only some ecotype groups affected by temperature
  %   arboreal taxa disappear by the Neogene
  %   only ecotypes with increasing trend digitigrade and unguligrade herbivores
